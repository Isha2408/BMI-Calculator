# 🧮 BMI Calculator

## 📌 Project Overview
The **BMI Calculator** is a simple Python-based application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's height and weight. It helps users understand their weight category according to standard BMI classifications.

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`BMI Calculator.ipynb`).

---

## 🚀 Features
- Takes user input for height and weight
- Calculates BMI using the standard formula
- Displays BMI value
- Categorizes BMI into:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obese
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

---

## 🧠 BMI Formula

\[
BMI = \frac{Weight (kg)}{Height (m)^2}
\]
